Working on
-- 4. Generate an order item for each record in the customers_orders table in the format of one of the following:
-- *Meat Lovers
-- *Meat Lovers - Exclude Beef
-- *Meat Lovers - Extra Bacon
-- *Meat Lovers - Exclude Cheese, Bacon - Extra Mushroom, Peppers
                        
with pizza_record as (select co.order_id,case
when co.pizza_id=pn.pizza_id then pn.pizza_name                        
else null end pizza_ordered,
case when ex1=topping_id then topping_name else null end toppings_ex1,
case when ex2=topping_id then topping_name else null end toppings_ex2,
case when ext1=topping_id then topping_name else null end toppings_extra1,
case when ext2=topping_id then topping_name else null end toppings_extra2
from customer_orders co,pizza_names pn,n_pizza_recipes pr, pizza_toppings pt
where co.pizza_id=pr.pizza_id
AND co.pizza_id=pn.pizza_id
AND n_toppings=topping_id)

-- Pricing and Ratings


-- 1. If a Meat Lovers pizza costs $12 and Vegetarian costs $10 and there were no charges for changes how much money has Pizza Runner made so far if there are no delivery fees?
                        
select '$' || sum(case when pizza_name='Vegetarian' then 10 else 12 end) revenue
from customer_orders co,n_runner_orders ro,pizza_names pr
where co.pizza_id=pr.pizza_id
and co.order_id=ro.order_id
and cancellation is null

-- 2. What if there was an additional $1 charge for any pizza extras?
-- Add cheese is $1 extra
                        
select '$' || sum(case when pizza_name='Vegetarian' then 10 else 12 
end)+
sum(case when ext1=4 or ext2=4 then 1 else 0 end) revenue                    
from customer_orders co,n_runner_orders ro,pizza_names pn
where co.pizza_id=pn.pizza_id
and co.order_id=ro.order_id
and cancellation is null
                        

-- 3. The Pizza Runner team now wants to add an additional ratings system that allows customers to rate their runner, how would you design an additional table for this new dataset - generate a schema for this new table and insert your own data for ratings for each successful customer order between 1 to 5.

drop table if exists runners_rating;
create table runners_rating (
runner_id integer references runners(runner_id),
order_id integer references customer_orders(order_id),
rating integer);


Which one works better and how to solve the issue with the unique matching constraints?
ALTER TABLE runners_rating 
add constraint fk_runner_id
FOREIGN KEY (runner_id) 
references runners(runner_id);

ALTER TABLE runners_rating 
add constraint fk_order_id
FOREIGN KEY (order_id) 
references customer_orders(order_id);
